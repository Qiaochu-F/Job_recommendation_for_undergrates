In the folder:

AHP2 contains the initial AHP code, where characters are randomly generated, resulting in different outcomes each time it's run. It's not necessary for actual demonstration.
AHP3 contains the modified AHP code, where characters are imported via data, resulting in consistent outcomes each time it's run. This version is intended for demonstration.
Work scores 12 are the scores obtained from the initial AHP and can be disregarded.
Work scores 34 are the files generated from the modified AHP code.
Score images 4 folder stores all the images generated by the modified AHP code. These may be overwritten during actual operation, but the folder should be retained.
Student ratings on factors 12 is the dataset required to be imported for the modified AHP code, and it should not be omitted.
AHP (without MAX-MIN normalization) is another dataset required for import, and it should not be omitted.
AHP method is a code used in the article as an example, specifically for the part of selecting weighting algorithms mentioned in the paper.
