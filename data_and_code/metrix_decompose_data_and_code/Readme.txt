Y represents the scores of 26 students on 31 jobs in the AHP results. Y2 and R2 represent sparse matrices obtained by adding a certain user's rating to a 231*326 matrix and increasing it by 500 data points. This is the adjusted dataset.

When running the code, you need to replace the file addresses in matdec.py with the address of Y.xls on your computer. Additionally, the addresses of Y2 and R2 in matdec_para,1,2 need to be changed, as well as the location of the "Learning Rate and Loss Function.xls" file in loss_time. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you!
